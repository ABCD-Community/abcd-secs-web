## ABCD SECS-WEB

Introduction

SeCS-Web (Serials in Health Sciences, from its acronym in Portuguese and Spanish) is the web version of the periodicals control system developed by BIREME. The SeCS methodology is used for the automatic control of serial holdings in the libraries and documentation centres participating in the Latinamerican and Caribbean Information Network on Health Sciences, which is part of the VHL – Virtual Health Library of BIREME/PAHO/WHO. With SeCS it is possible to control the periodicals holdings of each individual node in the network and also to maintain the Regional Catalogue of Journals in Health Sciences. 

SeCS-Web’s predecessor is the MS-DOS version originally developed in 1992. That version has evoluted progressively along the years incorporating the experiences of hundreds of medical libraries participating in the VHL. This accumulated experience enriches the current SeCS web version. 

SeCS has been adapted by BIREME to be incorporated in the ABCD Suite, which means that two working profiles can be used: the Standard profile for libraries not participating in the VHL (this is the default setting) and the Extended profile including the additional elements needed by BIREME. The extended profile must also be used by libraries who want to publish online periodicals web portals. The databases generated by SeCS-Web can be queried through the iAH interface that is also integrated in the ABCD Suite.

SeCS accomplishes several main and secondary supporting objectives in the services and products  
of the library, as can be seen from the figure below. The main roles are:  
 

*   Management of the periodicals collectionof a library in the traditional sense, including electronic publications. Management includes description of holdings as well as basic administrative  
    routines regarding vendors, subscriptions, exchange agreements, etc.
*   Management of Union Catalogues of periodicals for a group of libraries, belonging to one or several institutions.
*   Generation of Web Portals for access to electronic publications belonging to the library or available via Internet, whether the library subscribes to them or not.

Among the secondary objectives: support to cataloging of documents, the production of full text portals of the SciELO type and bibliometric studies. Products and services generated in SeCS can also be linked to other applications, such as update alert services (new acquisitions), on demand document delivery, lending systems, publications exchange, etc
